1/ Introduction to workflow and sass [Part 1].

  Learning about SASS's definition and how to implement it
	Definition: Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax". It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to 
  separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS" (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate rules 
  within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.
	
	SASS implementation: SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses  .scss file extension and is fully compatible with CSS syntax 
 Uses .sass file extension instead of bracket to do. It's not completely compatible with CSS syntax, but it's fast to write. Note that you can use the 
 sass convert command to convert a file from one syntax to another.
